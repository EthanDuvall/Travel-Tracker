## Wins
- Am happy with how the UI turned out
- happy with my pending and my past trips "tabs" look and function
- Another win is the functionality of this project i feel I did well on keeping mostly small and pure functions

## Struggles 
- A struggle I had was when posting I didn't realize that the value of the forms is all strings and so when I tried to post it wouldn't work due to the value i was pulling being a string when it needed to be a number and I fixed this by putting it in a Number() function
- Another struggle was deciding the design honestly it took me a few days to even decide on what I wanted this project to look like and while I'm happy with it currently I still feel it is really basic and could be better but i unfortunately don't know how to
